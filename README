web-dev / basic-bootstrap

This is very basic place to start hand made application building. `npm install` it and `grunt` - it just works.

Note - iff error about ruby and sass|haml: You might need to run `gem install sass` and `gem install haml` on some OSes.

HAML: use for building structure.
JS: use for interactivity.
SCSS: use for advanced styling.
