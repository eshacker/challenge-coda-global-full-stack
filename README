This is my attempt at the challenge. Please do not copy it during the challenge. 

# How to run?

`npm install`
`grunt && grunt serve` 

It just works!

Note - iff (sic) error about ruby and sass|haml: You might need to run `gem install sass` and `gem install haml` in some cases.

There are a ton of files that we might not be using. It's because of the boilerplate. Forked from eshacker/basic-bootstrap
